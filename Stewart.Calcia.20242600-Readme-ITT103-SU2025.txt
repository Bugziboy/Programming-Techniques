**          CATABOO HOSPITAL SYSTEM      **
**									                  	 **
*******************************************

**Purpose of the Program:**  
This is a basic terminal-based hospital management system built in Python. It allows staff to:
1. Register new patients
2. Add new doctors with schedules
3. Book appointments between patients and doctors
4. Cancel existing appointments
5. Generate bills for consultations and services
6. View patient profiles and appointment histories
7. View doctor profiles and schedules

**How to Run the Program:**  
1. Open a Python-supported text editor (like VS Code or Notepad++).
2. Save the program as `CATABOO HOSPITAL SYSTEM.py`.
3. Run the file using Python 3 from the terminal or command prompt:
4. Follow the on-screen menu options to interact with the system.

**Required Modifications **  
1. Add a login function for staff users.
2. Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.
3. Include search filters by date, doctor, or patient name.

**Assumptions and Limitations:**  
+ Data is lost once the program closes since all information is stored in memory only.
+ Patient and doctor IDs are auto-generated starting from fixed values (P1000, D5000, etc.).
+ The doctor's availability is manually entered as a list of (date, time) tuples.
+ The consultation fee is fixed at JMD $3000; only additional service fees can be added.
+ Date and time formats must be entered correctly as instructed (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD and HH:MM).
